Here is my algorithm for baking sugar cookies

- Input batches needed -> num_batches

- If batches needed is 0, then you're done!

- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees

- Gather ingredients equal to num_batches multiplied by quantity of each ingredient in the recipe

- In a bowl, whisk together gathered flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt

- In an electric mixer, mix the quantity of butter and sugar until well combined

- Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla to the electric mixer bowl and mix until well combined

- Add the contents from the dry ingredients bowl into the electric mixer bowl and mix until well combined

- While you still have cookie dough in the bowl
    - Gather a baking sheet

    - While your baking sheet is not full

        - Scoop 1 1/2 Tbsp of Cookie dough

        - Roll Cookie dough into a ball

        - Place on baking sheet

- Wait until the oven is preheated if needed

- While there is still baking sheets with raw cookie dough

    - Place a baking sheet with cookie dough on it in the oven

    - Wait for 9-11 minutes or until they appear baked

    - Take out pan and set it on a cooling rack

- Wait 5 minutes for the last batch of cookies to cooling

- Eat the cookies!
